# Bolleans

## Introduction

> What are Booleans or Bool ?

In programming, `booleans`, often abbreviated as `bool`, represent a data type with values of either `false` or `true`. Booleans are fundamental for making decisions in your code and controlling the flow of execution.

## Conditionals

In Luau, the language we are exploring, [conditional statements]() rely on the evaluation of expressions as either `false` or `true`. It's important to note that Luau considers values other than just `false` or `nil` as `true`. Surprisingly, even **zero** and an **empty string** are treated as `true` in Luau's conditional logic.

## Operators

To create intricate conditions in Luau, you can use a variety of operators. These include both [relational]() and [logical]() operators, allowing you to compare values and combine conditions to make more complex decisions in your code.

## Conclusion

Understanding Booleans, conditions and operators in Luau is essential to create effective decisions and control the flow of execution in your programs.
